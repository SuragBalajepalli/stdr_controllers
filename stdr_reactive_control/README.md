# stdr_open_loop_control

This package contains two nodes. One node- the lidar_alarm.cpp, publishes an alarm 'flag'. The other node subscribes to this alarm and makes decisions to prevent the stdr bot from colliding into an obstruction in the map.

This node is to be used after starting up a simulation of the stdr robot in a map.
